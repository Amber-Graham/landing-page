# landing-page
My first 'big' project for TOP.

Pre-work:
  my goal is to create a simple and cohesive layout based on the .png we were provided. I am going to put my spin on it (hopefully).

Reflection: 
  The goal of this page to test my current knowledge of html and css. Any and all suggestions to 'clean up' my code is appreciated. Hope you all like the theme. hehe. 

  - Happy coding
